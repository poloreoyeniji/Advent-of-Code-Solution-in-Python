# Advent of Code Solutions
![My-2023-AoC-dashboard](/2023/Capture.PNG)

This repository houses my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. The solutions are written in Python. As a personal challenge, I aim for optimal, readable and beginner-friendly solutions that serve as learning resources for others interested in problem-solving.

Follow along with my solutions in this repository. Please note that input files are not included due to copyright and [Eric Wastl's request](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/). You will need to adjust file paths to run the code.
