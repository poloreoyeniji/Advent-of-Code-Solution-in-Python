# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository houses my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. The solutions are written in both Python and JavaScript. As a personal challenge, I aim for optimal, readable and beginner-friendly solutions that serve as learning resources for others interested in problem-solving.

Follow along with my solutions in this repository. Please note that due to copyright and [Eric Wastl's request](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/), input files are not included. You will need to adjust file paths to run the code.

## Repository Organization
### Solutions
- **Solutions in Python**
  - **day-x**
    - `part-one.py`
    - `part-two.py`
- **Solutions in JavaScript**
  - **day-x**
    - `part-one.js`
    - `part-two.js`

### Helper Programs(TODO)
- **get-input**: Fetches the AoC server's input for a given day and saves it as a text file. Please adhere to the [usage limitations](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/automation/) specified.
  - **[`get-input.py`](helper_programs/get-input/get-input.py)**: Uses Python to get the puzzle input.
  - **[`get-input.js`](helper_programs/get-input/get-input.js)**: Uses JavaScript to get the puzzle input.

## Repository Navigation
To navigate this repository effectively:
- Python solutions are organized under respective days in the `solution-in-python` directory.
- JavaScript solutions follow a similar structure within the `solution-in-javascript` directory.
- Use the `tools` directory for helpful scripts such as to import puzzle input.
