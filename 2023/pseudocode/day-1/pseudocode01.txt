PART 1:
1. Initialize an empty list called list_of_calibration_values
2. Open the file 'puzzle-input.txt' and iterate through each line
    3. For each line, create an empty list list_of_calibration_values_for_each_line
    4. Iterate through each character in the line
        5. If the character is a digit, add it to list_of_calibration_values_for_each_line
    6. Take the first and last digits from list_of_calibration_values_for_each_line, concatenate them into a single digit, convert it to an integer, and add it to list_of_calibration_values
7. After processing all lines, calculate the sum of all digits in list_of_calibration_values
8. Print the total sum as the result
